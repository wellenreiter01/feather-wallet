Welcome to _Feathercoin Wallet_, a standalone Feathercoin payment app for your Android device!

*_The Android Wallet is not maintained anymore. See  http://forum.feathercoin.com/topic/9913/feathercoin-wallet-2-for-android-is-obsolete_*


This project contains several sub-projects:

 * __wallet__:
     The Android app itself. This is probably what you're searching for.
 * __market__:
     App description and promo material for the Google Play app store.
 * __integration-android__:
     A tiny library for integrating Feathercoin payments into your own Android app
     (e.g. donations, in-app purchases).
 * __sample-integration-android__:
     A minimal example app to demonstrate integration of Feathercoin payments into
     your Android app.

You can build all sub-projects at once using Maven:

`mvn clean install`
